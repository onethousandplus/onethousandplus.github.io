          our External Communications Director, if you have any further questions.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q3">+ What types of service projects are available?</h5>
          <p>Since there is a limited amount of work that can be done during a single day, the Project Planning team
          focuses on finding projects that involve more hands-on work. Check out the <a href="volunteer.html" style="font-weight:bold">Volunteer</a>
          page to see the list of projects!
          </p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q4">+ What is my time commitment for the day?</h5>
        <p>If you're volunteering in 1000plus, expect to spend 4-5 hours on the day of, either in the morning or afternoon.
          Specific times will be posted with each service project as our Project Planning team updates them, but here's a
          general overview of how the day works: You will report to the check-in station in the morning or afternoon
          depending on your project, check in with your site leader, and then proceed to a designated room where you will
          meet other volunteers. You will then be transported by bus to your service site,
          where you will perform the service and eventually be bussed back to campus.
          Contact your site leader for more details!</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q5">+ Will transportation be provided on the day of service?</h5>
        <p>Yes! 1000plus will provide buses to transport you to and from the volunteer site!</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q6">+ Do I get free food on the day of service?</h5>
        <p>Yes! Breakfast will be available for the volunteers when they check-in at Rangos (Cohen Center).
          Additionally, some service sites may be serving a meal or snacks.
          However, we would recommend bringing a snack and water just in case!</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q7">+ What is a site leader?</h5>
        <p>Site leaders act as the liaison between the 1000plus Executive Board and the service sites,
          visiting them before the Day of Service and ensuring all volunteers slated to attend each site
          make it to registration in time. They are also responsible for making sure volunteers are actively
          participating in civic engagement by facilitating a reflection before and after the Day of Service.
          Without our site leaders, it would simply be impossible to coordinate the sending of all of our volunteers
          throughout the Pittsburgh area!</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="Q8">+ When was 1000plus Day of Service started?</h5>
        <p>Spring 2008</p>
