        <h5 id="Q2">How do I register my group to volunteer together?</h5>
        <p>Registration for the Fall 2014 Day of Service is now closed.</p>

        <h5 id="Q3">What types of service projects are available?</h5>

        Adult Education & Literacy
        Animal Support
        Children & Youth
        Community Events/Enrichment
        Disaster Relief

        </p>

        <h5 id="Q4">What is my time commitment for the day?</h5>
        <p>If you're volunteering in 1000plus, expect to spend 4-5 hours on the day of, either in the morning or afternoon. Specific times will be posted with each service project as our Project Planning team updates them, but here's a general overview of how the day works: You will report to the check-in station in the morning or afternoon depending on your project, check in with your site leader, and then proceed to a designated room where you will complete a service activity and meet other volunteers. You will then be transported by bus to your service site, where you will perform the service and eventually be bussed back to the CUC. Contact your site leader for more details!</p>

        <h5 id="Q5">Will transportation be provided on the day of service?</h5>
        <p>Yes! 1000plus will provide buses to transport you to and from the volunteer site!</p>

        <h5 id="Q6">Do I get free food on the day of service?</h5>
        <p>Yes! Food will be available for the volunteers at the check-in rooms. Additionally, some service sites may be serving a meal or snacks. However, we would recommend bringing a snack and water just in case!</p>

        <h5 id="Q7">What is a site leader?</h5>
        <p>Site leaders act as the liaison between the 1000plus Exec Board and the service sites, visiting them before the Day of Service and ensuring all volunteers slated to attend each site make it to registration in time. They are also responsible for making sure volunteers are actively participating in civic engagement by facilitating a reflection before and after the Day of Service. Without our site leaders, it would simply be impossible to coordinate the sending of over 1000 volunteers all throughout the Pittsburgh area!</p>

        <h5 id="Q8">When was 1000plus started?</h5>
        <p>Spring 2008</p>
