Narrow, winding streets and a network of steps connect this unique hillside garden community. Many of the homes on the Slopes, originally built for immigrant workers who flocked to the mills and factories at the turn of the century, are of a distinctive, vernacular Victorian style. With the closing of the steel mills and economic hard times, the Slopes neighborhood was neglected. Over the past few years, there has been a renewed interest in this community. Concerned residents organized to draw attention to the wonderful opportunities afforded by the Slopes and have been advocating for the needs of the Slopes. We must continue to have a voice where decisions are being made. We have a strong working relationship with local government and agencies who allocate their resources to maintain and upgrade this marvelous neighborhood.

										<strong>Western PA Humane Society<strong>
									</div>
									<div class= "description">
										<em>Description:</em>
										There are thousands of animals who are given up every year. Sometimes people lose their jobs and can no longer afford to take care of their pets or have to move and cannot take their pets with them. Other times people experience life-changing events, such as a divorce or new baby, and have to surrender their furry friends. As more and more shelters become "limited access," people have no other choice than to surrender their pets to an open-door shelter, that will never turn away a pet in need. 
										Because of the stigma that open-door shelters have, many people choose to make donations to limited access shelters, when, in-fact, it's the open-door shelters who need the money the most. The Western PA Humane Society helps over 10,000 animals each and every year - which is a lot of mouths to feed and medications to administer. 
										<br>	
										<br>
										<em>Activity:</em>
										Volunteers will be assisting with renovation work, such as: painting, trash pick up on the dog walk route, planting flowers, etc. 
										*They will not be hands on with the animals.
