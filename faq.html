										<strong>What is my time commitment for the day?</strong>
									</div>
									<div class= "answer">
										If you're volunteering in 1000plus, expect to spend 4-5 hours on the
										day of, either in the morning or afternoon. Specific times will be
										posted with each service project as our Project Planning team updates
										them, but here's a general overview of how the day works: You will
										report to the check-in station in the morning or
										afternoon depending on your project, check in with your site leader,
										and then proceed to a designated room where you will complete a service activity
										and meet other volunteers. You will then be transported by bus to your
										service site, where you will perform the service and eventually be
										bussed back to the CUC. Contact your site leader for more details!

									<div class= "question">
										<strong>Do I get free food on the day of service?</strong>
									</div>
									<div class= "answer">
										Yes! Food will be available for the volunteers at the check-in rooms. Additionally,
										some service sites may be serving a meal or snacks. However, we would
										recommend bringing a snack and water just in case!

								<div id= "question6">
									<div class= "question">
										<strong>Will transportation be provided?</strong>

								<div id= "question7">
									<div class= "question">
										<strong>What is a site leader?</strong>
									</div>
									<div class= "answer">
										Site leaders act as the liaison between the 1000plus Exec Board and the
										service sites, visiting them before the Day of Service and ensuring
										all volunteers slated to attend each site make it to registration in
										time. They are also responsible for making sure volunteers are
										actively participating in civic engagement by facilitating a
										reflection before and after the Day of Service. Without our site
										leaders, it would simply be impossible to coordinate the sending of
										over 1000 volunteers all throughout the Pittsburgh area!
